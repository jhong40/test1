It is hidden in the center of a temple. You know that this is your big chance to get famous, so you set out the next day. The forest if filled with tigers and black widow spiders. After an hour of walking, you come by a path thats leading in the same direction as to where you are going, but it would be a little longer of a walk. There may be boobie traps, but at least no animals would come at you due to the tall get on either side of the path. Will you go on the path?</h3>
